# ðŸ§  Prompt Library for AI-Powered Development

This repository contains a curated collection of engineering-grade prompts designed to guide AI assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)

## ðŸ§© Purpose

The goal is to **maximize precision, clarity, and context-awareness** when working with AI tools in real-world projects.

## ðŸ›  Prompt Usage

These prompts are structured to work best with ChatGPT Web or other LLM interfaces. Each one sets a **role, behavior, formatting rules**, and **tech constraints** to make the AI behave like a reliable senior engineer in your stack.

Use them when you want AI to:

- Assist in debugging real code
- Review or write production-grade PHP
- Act within strict Laravel/WordPress/Bitrix conventions
- Understand infrastructure and deployment constraints

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each prompt is stored as a standalone `.md` file.
